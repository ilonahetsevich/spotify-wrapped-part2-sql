<h1>Spotify Wrapped: A Deep Dive Into 8 Years of Data
<br />
Part 2. Analyzing Spotify Data Using SQL
</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

<p><b>Objective:</b> To analyze my Spotify listening habits over the past 8 years, uncovering how they have evolved over time, what influences these changes, and what they reveal about my music preferences and behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Questions to answer:</b></p>
<p><b>Listening trends over time</b></p>

- How much time did I spend listening to Spotify, and how have my habits changed?<br />
- How much time did I spend listening to music versus podcasts?<br />
- What days of the week and times of the day do I listen the most?

<p><b>Artists, songs, gernes, and podcasts</b></p>

- Which artists and songs have been my favorites, and how have they changed over time?<br />
- What are my top podcasts over the years?<br />
- Do I skip songs often? What genres do I skip the most?<br />
- How often do I explore new music versus sticking with familiar favorites?

<p><b>Device preferences and lifestyle</b></p>

- What device do I use the most: desktop, mobile, or maybe TV?<br />
- How has my device usage evolved alongside lifestyle changes, like working remotely or pandemic?<br />
- How does Spotify fit into my daily routine - background noise, focused listening, or exploring new music?

<i> <b> Disclaimer: </b> I analyzed 8 years of Spotify data, but since the data was requested on December 6th, 2024, I didn't have any information for the remaining days of December. Rather than excluding December entirely and limiting the analysis to overlapping months across all years, I chose to use metrics like average listening time per day. This approach accounts for variations in the number of active days, normalizes the data, and ensures fair comparisons between years.</i>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p> I was most active in Spotify listening around 2018â€“2019, with a gradual decline in recent years. My peak listening year was 2019, when I spent an average of <b>2.2 hours per day</b> on Spotify. Starting in 2020, with the onset of the pandemic and the shift to remote work, my listening time began to decline steadily, reaching <b>1.24 hours/day in 2024 - a 43.6% drop</b> compared to the peak in 2019.</p>
<p>Podcasts have become an increasingly important part of my listening habits, though they remain secondary to music. Their share of total listening time grew from <b>3.12% in 2018 to 7.16%</b> in 2024, indicating a consistent increase in interest. Notably, the time I spent listening to podcasts <b>skyrocketed by 169%</b> in 2020, likely driven by lifestyle changes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My listening diversity has expanded over time. In 2023, I explored <b>1 750 unique artists</b> and listened to <b>the highest-ever number of unique music tracks (2 970)</b>. This suggests a growing curiosity and openness to discovering new music.</p>
<p>The average number of plays per music track has decreased steadily, from <b>3.9 in 2019 to 2.05 in 2023</b> - almost 2 times lower. This shift points to an exploratory approach to music, with less emphasis on replaying the same songs. For podcasts, the average plays per episode have remained stable (<b>around 1.0â€“1.39</b>), indicating that I tend to listen to podcasts only once.
</p>
<p>Overall, my Spotify habits have shifted over the years toward more <b>diverse, and exploratory engagement</b>, with music taking a slightly reduced role and podcasts steadily gaining ground</p>

<h3>1.2 Monthly Spotify Listening Trends</h3>


<h5>Script to pull monthly listening stats:</h5> 

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR,
    MONTH,
    CASE 
        WHEN MONTH IN (1,2,12) THEN 'Winter'
        WHEN MONTH IN (3,4,5) THEN 'Spring'
        WHEN MONTH IN (6,7,8) THEN 'Summer'
        ELSE 'Autumn'
    END AS season,
    ROUND(SUM(MIN_PLAYED)/60,2) AS hours_played
FROM "SAMPLE_SCHEMA"."PUBLIC"."SPOTIFY_WRAPPED"
GROUP BY YEAR, MONTH, season
ORDER BY YEAR, MONTH, season ASC;

```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p>My listening habits remain fairly consistent across the seasons, but Summer and Winter tend to dominate overall, reflecting increased activity during holidays and colder months. External factors, such as lifestyle changes or major events, also play a significant role. For instance, in 2020, Spring led with 35.05% of my total listening time, likely due to spending more time indoors during the pandemic. In 2024, Winter reclaimed the top spot (32.93% of total listening time), driven by my heavy running load during that season.</p>

<h3>1.3 Weekly Listening Habits</h3>


<h5>Script to pull weekly listening stats:</h5>

    TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') AS abbreviated_day_name,
    YEAR,
    ROUND(SUM(MIN_PLAYED)/60,2) AS hours_played,
    CASE 
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Mon' THEN 1
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Tue' THEN 2
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Wed' THEN 3
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Thu' THEN 4
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Fri' THEN 5
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Sat' THEN 6
        WHEN TO_CHAR(DATE, 'DY') = 'Sun' THEN 7
    END AS day_order
FROM "SAMPLE_SCHEMA"."PUBLIC"."SPOTIFY_WRAPPED"
GROUP BY 1,2,7
ORDER BY day_order, YEAR ASC;

```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p>My listening habits peak on weekdays, with Friday being the most active day. This could be attributed to the lighter workload on Fridays, which allows me to use music as background noise while I focus on less mentally demanding tasks.</p>
<p>However, over time, my listening patterns have shifted significantly:</p>

- <b>2017â€“2019:</b> Listening was highly concentrated on weekdays, especially Friday, which consistently dominated as the most active day (~ 21% of total listening). Weekends saw minimal activity during this period.<br />
- <b>2020:</b> The pandemic disrupted established patterns. Listening became more evenly distributed across the week, with notable increases on weekends and even weekdays like Tuesday (23.03%), likely reflecting changes in daily routines during the work-from-home period.<br />
- <b>2021â€“2022: </b>Weekend listening grew significantly, particularly on Saturdays in 2022, which accounted for 24.90% of total listening time. This marked a shift toward leisure-focused listening habits.<br />
- <b>2023â€“2024: </b>Sunday emerged as the most prominent day, growing from just ~4% of total listening time in 2018 to a striking 17.65% in 2024. This shift can largely be attributed to my regular running sessions on weekends (Sundays - long run days), which started in 2023 and have significantly increased my listening time during these days.<br />
<p>These changes reflect a gradual move away from weekday-focused listening to a more weekend-centered pattern, influenced by lifestyle changes such as running.</p>

FROM "SAMPLE_SCHEMA"."PUBLIC"."SPOTIFY_WRAPPED"
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6
ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5,6;

```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p>From 2017 to early 2020, my listening habits were heavily concentrated in the mornings (over 50% of total listening time), driven by my daily commute. Despite the pandemic and working from home in 2020, my morning listening remained strong thanks to walking my new dog. In 2023, as I developed a regular running habit, my mornings became slightly less dominant, with a noticeable shift toward the afternoon and evening. Additionally, my summer trips to the U.S. in 2023 and 2024 led to an increase in night-time listening.</p>

ORDER BY 1

```

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p>I rarely skip songs on Spotify, with only 2% of tracks being skipped. This is likely due to my use of daily playlists, which are usually well-curated to my taste. Additionally, since I often play Spotify as background music while working, I don't pay close attention to every track, making me less likely to skip them.
