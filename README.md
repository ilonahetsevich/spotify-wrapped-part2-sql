<i> <b> Disclaimer: </b> I analyzed 8 years of Spotify data, but since the data was requested on December 6th, 2024, I didn't have any information for the remaining days of December. Rather than excluding December entirely and limiting the analysis to overlapping months across all years, I chose to use metrics like average listening time per day. This approach accounts for variations in the number of active days, normalizes the data, and ensures fair comparisons between years.</i>
