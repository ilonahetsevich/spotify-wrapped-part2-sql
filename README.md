<h1>Spotify Wrapped: A Deep Dive Into 8 Years of Data
<br />
Part 2. Analyzing Spotify Data Using SQL
</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

<p><b>Objective:</b> To analyze my Spotify listening habits over the past 8 years, uncovering how they have evolved over time, what influences these changes, and what they reveal about my music preferences and behaviors.</p>

<p><b>Questions to answer:</b></p>
<p><b>Listening trends over time</b></p>

- How much time did I spend listening to Spotify, and how have my habits changed?<br />
- How much time did I spend listening to music versus podcasts?<br />
- What days of the week and times of the day do I listen the most?

<p><b>Artists, songs, gernes, and podcasts</b></p>

- Which artists and songs have been my favorites, and how have they changed over time?<br />
- What are my top podcasts over the years?<br />
- Do I skip songs often? What genres do I skip the most?<br />
- How often do I explore new music versus sticking with familiar favorites?

<p><b>Device preferences and lifestyle</b></p>

- What device do I use the most: desktop, mobile, or maybe TV?<br />
- How has my device usage evolved alongside lifestyle changes, like working remotely or pandemic?<br />
- How does Spotify fit into my daily routine - background noise, focused listening, or exploring new music?

<i> <b> Disclaimer: </b> I analyzed 8 years of Spotify data, but since the data was requested on December 6th, 2024, I didn't have any information for the remaining days of December. Rather than excluding December entirely and limiting the analysis to overlapping months across all years, I chose to use metrics like average listening time per day. This approach accounts for variations in the number of active days, normalizes the data, and ensures fair comparisons between years.</i>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Learnings:</h3>
<p> I was most active in Spotify listening around 2018â€“2019, with a gradual decline in recent years. My peak listening year was 2019, when I spent an average of <b>2.2 hours per day</b> on Spotify. Starting in 2020, with the onset of the pandemic and the shift to remote work, my listening time began to decline steadily, reaching <b>1.24 hours/day in 2024 - a 43.6% drop</b> compared to the peak in 2019.</p>
<p>Podcasts have become an increasingly important part of my listening habits, though they remain secondary to music. Their share of total listening time grew from <b>3.12% in 2018 to 7.16%</b> in 2024, indicating a consistent increase in interest. Notably, the time I spent listening to podcasts <b>skyrocketed by 169%</b> in 2020, likely driven by lifestyle changes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>My listening diversity has expanded over time. In 2023, I explored <b>1 750 unique artists</b> and listened to <b>the highest-ever number of unique music tracks (2 970)</b>. This suggests a growing curiosity and openness to discovering new music.</p>
<p>The average number of plays per music track has decreased steadily, from <b>3.9 in 2019 to 2.05 in 2023</b> - almost 2 times lower. This shift points to an exploratory approach to music, with less emphasis on replaying the same songs. For podcasts, the average plays per episode have remained stable (<b>around 1.0â€“1.39</b>), indicating that I tend to listen to podcasts only once.
</p>
<p>Overall, my Spotify habits have shifted over the years toward more <b>diverse, and exploratory engagement</b>, with music taking a slightly reduced role and podcasts steadily gaining ground</p>
